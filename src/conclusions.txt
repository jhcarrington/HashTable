Complete the profiling part of the assignment using java flight recorder before 
answering the following questions.

1.) What can you tell about the performance of your hash table implementation compared to Java's tree map? Explain why it is better/worse.
The performance of our hash table was better than the performance of Java's tree map. 
The TreeMap class is a red black tree which has an average time complexity of O(log(N)) for inserting and deleting. 
Our hashTable class has a best case time complexity of O(1) and a worst case of O(N) for inserting and deleting. 
With a good hash function the average case for a hash table is O(1). So our hashTable should perform better than Java's treemap  

2.) What did you observe in java mission control to come to the conclusion above?
We observed in the code tab of JMC that the percentage of time spent on the TreeMap was significantly higher than the time spent on our HashTable
